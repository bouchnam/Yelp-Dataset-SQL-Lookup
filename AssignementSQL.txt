Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table =  10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 for the primary key : "id"
ii. Hours = 1562 for the foreign key : "business_id"
iii. Category = 2643 for the foreign key : "business_id"
iv. Attribute = 1115 for the foreign key : "business_id"
v. Review = 10000 for the primary key : "id", 8090  for the foreign key : "business_id", 9581  for the foreign key : "business_id"
vi. Checkin = 493  for the foreign key : "business_id"
vii. Photo = 10000 for the primary key : "id",
viii. Tip =
ix. User =
x. Friend =
xi. Elite_years =

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:




Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

I have chosen Pittsburgh as a city,and Food as a category.
for the total number of hours, I found that the businesses with 4-5 stars have more hours than the other with 2-3 stars.
For the food category, I found that it had only businesses with 4-5 stars
THE 4-5 stars business contain the attribute WheelchairAccessible, and the 2-3 stars contain BusinessParking


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
No , the 2-3 group has 12 reviews but the 4-5 group has 11 reviews. It look actually like they have approximately the same number of reviews.

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Actually, neighborhood didn't give me more information to reach a conclusion

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT B.stars, H.hours
from business B INNER JOIN hours H
ON B.id == H.business_id
WHERE city = 'Pittsburgh'
group by stars

+-------+----------------------+
| stars | hours                |
+-------+----------------------+
|   2.5 | Saturday|11:00-3:00  |
|   3.0 | Saturday|11:00-0:00  |
|   5.0 | Saturday|10:00-18:00 |
+-------+----------------------+

SELECT C.category, B.stars
FROM category C INNER JOIN business B
ON C.business_id = B.id
WHERE B.city = 'Pittsburgh'
group by B.stars

+-----------+-------+
| category  | stars |
+-----------+-------+
| Pizza     |   2.5 |
| Mexican   |   3.0 |
| Nightlife |   3.5 |
| Food      |   4.5 |
| Shopping  |   5.0 |
+-----------+-------+

SELECT Count(R.id) as reviews, B.stars
FROM business B INNER JOIN review R
ON B.id = R.business_id
WHERE B.city = 'Pittsburgh'
group by B.stars

+---------+-------+
| reviews | stars |
+---------+-------+
|       1 |   2.0 |
|       1 |   2.5 |
|       3 |   3.0 |
|       7 |   3.5 |
|       5 |   4.0 |
|       5 |   4.5 |
|       1 |   5.0 |
+---------+-------+

SELECT neighborhood, stars
from business
WHERE city = 'Pittsburgh'
group by stars

+-------------------+-------+
| neighborhood      | stars |
+-------------------+-------+
|                   |   1.0 |
| The Hill District |   1.5 |
|                   |   2.0 |
|                   |   2.5 |
| Greentree         |   3.0 |
|                   |   3.5 |
| South Side        |   4.0 |
|                   |   4.5 |
| Overbrook         |   5.0 |
+-------------------+-------+

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

i. Difference 1:

sum of review_count equals to 35261 where is_open(closed) is 0 and 269300 where is_open = 1


ii. Difference 2:

number of businesses is 1520 for the closed ones and 8480 for the opened

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT  SUM(review_count),
COUNT(id),
*
from business
GROUP BY is_open

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I am gonna try to predict if it's a good choice to start your new business in a specific location

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I have chosen that type of date to analyze because I believe it's a good choice to predict and review all the statistics
about a location before you start your new business so you can maximize the opportunity of success and minimize the risk.
Am gonna also study the number of reviews because if will give us the information about how a business is popular in that location,
so if the number of revies is low in the business you wanna open , it's a good opportunity for your business to grow up.
we have to study also the number of stars so you can push your new work in right place.
